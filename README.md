# reddit-search

## about
This site is meant to help with searching on reddit! I often find myself adding 'reddit' to the end of many of my google searches to find results on reddit, and got annoyed with constantly having to type out 'reddit' each time. The search field on this site does that for you.

*__note:__ mobile optimization still needed.*
